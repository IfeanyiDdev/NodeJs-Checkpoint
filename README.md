# NodeJs-Checkpoint
This Project consists of 5 tasks.
This first task  is a simple program  (hello world.js) that prints to the console "Hello world".
The second task is a program that creates a server and outputs a bare html- containing Hello Node!!!! in h1- on port 3000.
The third task is a program reads a text file "welcome.txt" and prints to the console, the content of that text file. I did this synchronously and asynchronously.
The fourth task is a program that generate randome passwords and print them to the console. It uses the password-generator module. It includes some rules to ensure the passwords have some intergrity.
The final task is a program that takes advantage of the nodemailer module to send a text from one email address to another.
